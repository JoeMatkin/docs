Our API has taken heavy inspiration from [Stripe's](https://docs.stripe.com/api) own API whilst making improvements in areas.

We have a core structure / featured behind certain requests

- Pagination (List)
- Filter (List)
- Expand (All Requests)

GridMind is built on the folowing core principels:

- Consitency (request structure, response structure, error messages)
- Functionality first, design follows
- Full required functioanltiy with the most mimimal implementaion possible
- Domain driven with monolithic approach (domain interfaces are shared)
- We abstract as little as possible from the truth, by doing this we aim to create a 1 to 1 map of your acctual businesses structure / processes with your WMS (GridMind)
